# Optimizing Deep Learning

This assignment focuses on predicting stock prices using NVIDIA Corporationâ€™s (NVDA) historical stock data, spanning from 2015 to 2024. The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammaddawood42/nvidia-stock-data), sourced from Kaggle, includes daily stock price information such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Adjusted Close prices, as well as trading volume. This rich dataset provides an excellent foundation for exploring deep learning techniques in time-series forecasting.

Two predictive neural network models are used in this project: the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) Hybrid model. The LSTM model, a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), is designed to effectively handle sequential data by capturing long-term dependencies and patterns over time. The CNN-LSTM hybrid model leverages the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in feature extraction and combines them with the temporal learning capabilities of LSTMs, making it well-suited for complex time-series data like stock prices.
